Question = Question:  A graph of population size over time. More information in long description.  © 2020 StrongMind    Population Size Over Time Image  Long Description  A graph showing the growth of a population over time. Vertical y-axis shows the population size. A trend line shows what starts out as an S-shaped curve. At the top, the plot levels out, but not to a straight horizontal line. Instead, the line wobbles above and below where an imaginary horizontal line representing the carrying capacity would be. Four points are shown on the line. A is the inflection point located on the S-shaped curve below the line representing the carrying capacity. B is a point on the S-shaped curve where it intersects with the carrying capacity. C is a point on the S-shaped curve above the carrying capacity where the population size is about to drop. D is a point much further along on the plot where the population is exactly at the carrying capacity.               Which point on the graph indicates where resources first become limiting?
