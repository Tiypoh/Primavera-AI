Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “Primates, Empathy, and Making Connections.”    Below my office window at the Yerkes Primate Center, I often hear my chimps laugh during rough-and-tumble games, and I cannot suppress a chuckle myself. It’s such a happy sound. Tickling and wrestling are the typical laugh triggers for apes, and probably the original ones for humans. The fact that tickling oneself is notoriously ineffective attests to its social significance. And when young apes put on their play face, their friends join in with the same expression as rapidly and easily as humans do with laughter.    Which phrases from the excerpt show the author’s stylistic choice to use specific words so the reader can picture the actions of the chimps?    Select all that apply.    Primates, Empathy, and Making Connections

Question = Question:  Read the sentence from “How Not to Raise a Bully: The Early Roots of Empathy.”    Spartans, who were celebrated almost exclusively as warriors, raised their ruling-class boys in an environment of uncompromising brutality—enlisting them in boot camp at age 7 and starving them to encourage enough deviousness and cunning to steal food, which skillfully bred yet more generations of ruthless killers.

Question = Question:  Read the opening paragraph from “Primates, Empathy, and Making Connections.”    What intrigues me most about laughter is how it spreads. It’s almost impossible not to laugh when everybody else is. There have been laughing epidemics, in which no one could stop and some even died in a prolonged fit. There are laughing churches and laugh therapies based on the healing power of laughter. The must-have toy of 1996—Tickle Me Elmo—laughed hysterically after being squeezed three times in a row. All of this because we love to laugh and can’t resist joining laughing around us. This is why comedy shows on television have laugh tracks and why theater audiences are sometimes sprinkled with “laugh plants”: people paid to produce raucous laughing at any joke that comes along.    The infectiousness of laughter even works across species.    How does the information in the excerpt help contribute to the meaning and power of the word infectiousness?    Primates, Empathy, and Making Connections

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “Everyday Survival.”    And yet almost any organized action can help you recover the ability to think clearly and aid in your survival. For example, Pvt. Giles McCoy was aboard the U.S.S. Indianapolis when it was torpedoed and sank at the end of World War II, tossing some 900 men into the black of night and the shark-infested Pacific. McCoy, a young Marine, was sucked under the boat and nearly drowned. He surfaced into a two-inch-thick slick of fuel oil, which soaked his life vest and kept him from swimming—although he could see a life raft, he couldn’t reach it. So he tore off his vest and swam underwater, surfacing now and then, gasping, swallowing oil, and vomiting. After getting hoisted onto the raft, he saw a group of miserable young sailors covered in oil and retching. One was “so badly burned that the skin was stripped from his arms,” Doug Stanton writes in his gripping account of the event, In Harm’s Way. McCoy’s response to this horrific situation was telling. “He resolved to take action: He would clean his pistol.” Irrelevant as that task may sound, it was exactly the right thing to do: organized, directed action. He made each one of the sailors hold a piece of the pistol as he disassembled it. This began the process of letting him think clearly. Forcing your brain to think sequentially—in times of crisis and in day-to-day life—can quiet dangerous emotions.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “Everyday Survival.”    Be careful who you go into the backcountry with. Some people just have it stamped on their foreheads: “I am going to die in a wilderness accident.” But to recognize this stamp, you must pay attention to some very subtle signals. Researchers such as Elaine Hatfield at the University of Hawaii and Paul Ekman at the National Institutes of Health have studied nonverbal communication since the 1960s and concluded that it conveys essential information, which we ignore at our peril. It can be anything from a gesture to a slight change in facial expression. Most people will respond to such signals by feeling either comfortable or ill at ease with someone for no known reason.

Question = Question:  Read the paragraph from “The History of the Electric Car,” which claims that the Model T represented a major setback for electric cars.    Yet, it was Henry Ford’s mass-produced Model T that dealt a blow to the electric car. Introduced in 1908, the Model T made gasoline-powered cars widely available and affordable. By 1912, the gasoline car cost only $650, while an electric roadster sold for $1,750. That same year, Charles Kettering introduced the electric starter, eliminating the need for the hand crank and giving rise to more gasoline-powered vehicle sales.

Question = Question:  Which statement most accurately combines and summarizes the information from the “Plastics” article and the “What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris” brochure about how plastics break down?    Plastics    What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris      Long Description: What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris  Long Description: What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris  From the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration    Introduction  One of the main types of marine debris that you hear about today is plastic marine debris. In many places, it is the main type of debris that you will see as you walk along a beach, though perhaps not underwater. As common as they are on our beaches and in our homes, how much do you really know about plastics?    What is plastic marine debris?    The word “plastic” is used to describe a collection of artificial or manmade chemical compounds that come in about as many shapes, sizes, and colors as you can imagine! For example, foam carryout containers (made of polystyrene) and bottle caps (made of polypropylene) are items that would be considered plastic marine debris if found in our oceans or waterways.    Some common types of plastic:  Acronym    Full name    Common Example  PET (PETE)      Polyethylene terephthalate   soda bottles  PES       Polyester (yes, it's actually a plastic!)       polyester clothing  PE  Polyethylene plastic bags  HDPE      High-density polyethylene       detergent bottles  PVC  Polyvinyl chloride      plumbing pipes  PP   Polypropylene   drinking straws  PA     Polyamide (aka nylon)   toothbrushes  PS        Polystyrene take-out food containers  Why is plastic marine debris so common?  Plastics are used in many aspects of daily life, are a big part of our waste stream, and can last a long time. Many plastics are colorful and will float in water, which makes plastic debris a very visible part of the marine debris problem. However, an accurate estimate does not yet exist for how much debris is composed of plastic materials.    Do plastics “go away”?  Plastics will degrade into small pieces until you can’t see them anymore (so small you’d need a microscope or better!). Because the ocean is a cold, dark place, this process happens slower in water than on land. But, do plastics fully “go away?” Full degradation into carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic molecules is called mineralization. Most commonly used plastics do not mineralize (or go away) in the ocean and instead break down into smaller and smaller pieces. We call these pieces “microplastics” if they are less than 5mm long.     Bio-based and truly biodegradable plastics break down in a compost pile or landfill, but are generally not designed to degrade as quickly in the ocean.    Can plastic marine debris harm fish?  Plastic has the potential to harm fish and other wildlife in two main ways.    Direct Impacts - Studies have shown that fish and other marine life do eat plastic. Plastics could cause irritation or damage to the digestive system. If plastics are kept in the gut instead of passing through, the fish could feel full (of plastic not food) and this could lead to malnutrition or starvation.    Indirect Impacts - Plastic debris accumulates pollutants such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) up to 100,000 to 1,000,000 times the levels found in seawater. PCBs, which were mainly used as coolant fluids, were banned in the U.S. in 1979 and internationally in 2001. It is still unclear whether these pollutants can seep from plastic debris into the organisms that happen to eat the debris and very difficult to determine the exact source of these pollutants as they can come from sources other than plastic debris. More research is needed to help better understand these areas.    What can we do?  Get involved! Participate in local cleanups in your area.  Remember that the land and sea, no matter where you are, are connected.  Reduce the amount of waste you produce.  Reuse items whenever possible. Choose reusable items over disposable ones.  Recycle as much as possible. Bottles, cans, cell phones, ink cartridges, and many other items can be recycled.

Plastics    Plastics in the Ocean      Long Description: Plastics in the Ocean  From the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration    Plastics are the most common form of marine debris. They can come from a variety of land- and ocean-based sources, enter the water in many ways, and impact the ocean and Great Lakes. Once in the water, plastic debris never fully biodegrades.    Infographic text:  Commonly found Plastics include cigarette butts, food wrappers, beverage bottles, straws, cups & plates, bottle caps, and single-use bags.    How to help? Reduce, reuse, recycle. Dispose of waste properly no matter where you are. Get involved and participate in local cleanups in your area. Remember that our land and sea are connected.    Impacts include:  Entanglement: Marine life can get caught and killed in derelict fishing nets and other plastic debris.  Ingestion: Animals can easily mistake plastic debris for food.  Sources include:  Boats/nets: Fishing gear can become marine debris when it is lost or abandoned.  Littering: Intentional littering or improper disposal of trash can cause marine debris.  Debris can enter the water via:  Rain & winds: Rain and wind can sweep debris into nearby waterbodies.  Streams & storm drains: Streams and storm drains can carry debris directly into the ocean or Great Lakes.  Microplastics are small plastics less that 5mm. They can come from large plastics breaking down, or can be produced as small plastics such as microbeads, which can be found in products such as toothpaste and face wash.

Question = Question:  Which statement most accurately combines and summarizes the information from the “Plastics” article and the “What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris” brochure about how plastics break down?    Plastics    What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris      Long Description: What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris  Long Description: What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris  From the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration    Introduction  One of the main types of marine debris that you hear about today is plastic marine debris. In many places, it is the main type of debris that you will see as you walk along a beach, though perhaps not underwater. As common as they are on our beaches and in our homes, how much do you really know about plastics?    What is plastic marine debris?    The word “plastic” is used to describe a collection of artificial or manmade chemical compounds that come in about as many shapes, sizes, and colors as you can imagine! For example, foam carryout containers (made of polystyrene) and bottle caps (made of polypropylene) are items that would be considered plastic marine debris if found in our oceans or waterways.    Some common types of plastic:  Acronym    Full name    Common Example  PET (PETE)      Polyethylene terephthalate   soda bottles  PES       Polyester (yes, it's actually a plastic!)       polyester clothing  PE  Polyethylene plastic bags  HDPE      High-density polyethylene       detergent bottles  PVC  Polyvinyl chloride      plumbing pipes  PP   Polypropylene   drinking straws  PA     Polyamide (aka nylon)   toothbrushes  PS        Polystyrene take-out food containers  Why is plastic marine debris so common?  Plastics are used in many aspects of daily life, are a big part of our waste stream, and can last a long time. Many plastics are colorful and will float in water, which makes plastic debris a very visible part of the marine debris problem. However, an accurate estimate does not yet exist for how much debris is composed of plastic materials.    Do plastics “go away”?  Plastics will degrade into small pieces until you can’t see them anymore (so small you’d need a microscope or better!). Because the ocean is a cold, dark place, this process happens slower in water than on land. But, do plastics fully “go away?” Full degradation into carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic molecules is called mineralization. Most commonly used plastics do not mineralize (or go away) in the ocean and instead break down into smaller and smaller pieces. We call these pieces “microplastics” if they are less than 5mm long.     Bio-based and truly biodegradable plastics break down in a compost pile or landfill, but are generally not designed to degrade as quickly in the ocean.    Can plastic marine debris harm fish?  Plastic has the potential to harm fish and other wildlife in two main ways.    Direct Impacts - Studies have shown that fish and other marine life do eat plastic. Plastics could cause irritation or damage to the digestive system. If plastics are kept in the gut instead of passing through, the fish could feel full (of plastic not food) and this could lead to malnutrition or starvation.    Indirect Impacts - Plastic debris accumulates pollutants such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) up to 100,000 to 1,000,000 times the levels found in seawater. PCBs, which were mainly used as coolant fluids, were banned in the U.S. in 1979 and internationally in 2001. It is still unclear whether these pollutants can seep from plastic debris into the organisms that happen to eat the debris and very difficult to determine the exact source of these pollutants as they can come from sources other than plastic debris. More research is needed to help better understand these areas.    What can we do?  Get involved! Participate in local cleanups in your area.  Remember that the land and sea, no matter where you are, are connected.  Reduce the amount of waste you produce.  Reuse items whenever possible. Choose reusable items over disposable ones.  Recycle as much as possible. Bottles, cans, cell phones, ink cartridges, and many other items can be recycled.

Question = Question:  Look at the photograph from the brochure “What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris.”    The ocean floor covered with a layer of plastic waste and smaller plastic pieces jumbled together.  Photo courtesy of NOAA Restoraction Center.    Which statements from the brochure best support the information presented in the photograph?    Select all that apply.    What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris      Long Description: What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris  Long Description: What We Know About: Plastic Marine Debris  From the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration    Introduction  One of the main types of marine debris that you hear about today is plastic marine debris. In many places, it is the main type of debris that you will see as you walk along a beach, though perhaps not underwater. As common as they are on our beaches and in our homes, how much do you really know about plastics?    What is plastic marine debris?    The word “plastic” is used to describe a collection of artificial or manmade chemical compounds that come in about as many shapes, sizes, and colors as you can imagine! For example, foam carryout containers (made of polystyrene) and bottle caps (made of polypropylene) are items that would be considered plastic marine debris if found in our oceans or waterways.    Some common types of plastic:  Acronym    Full name  Common Example  PET (PETE)   Polyethylene terephthalate      soda bottles  PES       Polyester (yes, it's actually a plastic!)   polyester clothing  PE   Polyethylene    plastic bags  HDPE      High-density polyethylene       detergent bottles  PVC       Polyvinyl chloride      plumbing pipes  PP      Polypropylene   drinking straws  PA     Polyamide (aka nylon)toothbrushes  PS        Polystyrene     take-out food containers  Why is plastic marine debris so common?  Plastics are used in many aspects of daily life, are a big part of our waste stream, and can last a long time. Many plastics are colorful and will float in water, which makes plastic debris a very visible part of the marine debris problem. However, an accurate estimate does not yet exist for how much debris is composed of plastic materials.    Do plastics “go away”?  Plastics will degrade into small pieces until you can’t see them anymore (so small you’d need a microscope or better!). Because the ocean is a cold, dark place, this process happens slower in water than on land. But, do plastics fully “go away?” Full degradation into carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic molecules is called mineralization. Most commonly used plastics do not mineralize (or go away) in the ocean and instead break down into smaller and smaller pieces. We call these pieces “microplastics” if they are less than 5mm long.     Bio-based and truly biodegradable plastics break down in a compost pile or landfill, but are generally not designed to degrade as quickly in the ocean.    Can plastic marine debris harm fish?  Plastic has the potential to harm fish and other wildlife in two main ways.    Direct Impacts - Studies have shown that fish and other marine life do eat plastic. Plastics could cause irritation or damage to the digestive system. If plastics are kept in the gut instead of passing through, the fish could feel full (of plastic not food) and this could lead to malnutrition or starvation.    Indirect Impacts - Plastic debris accumulates pollutants such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) up to 100,000 to 1,000,000 times the levels found in seawater. PCBs, which were mainly used as coolant fluids, were banned in the U.S. in 1979 and internationally in 2001. It is still unclear whether these pollutants can seep from plastic debris into the organisms that happen to eat the debris and very difficult to determine the exact source of these pollutants as they can come from sources other than plastic debris. More research is needed to help better understand these areas.    What can we do?  Get involved! Participate in local cleanups in your area.  Remember that the land and sea, no matter where you are, are connected.  Reduce the amount of waste you produce.  Reuse items whenever possible. Choose reusable items over disposable ones.  Recycle as much as possible. Bottles, cans, cell phones, ink cartridges, and many other items can be recycled.

Plastics in the Ocean      Long Description: Plastics in the Ocean  From the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration    Plastics are the most common form of marine debris. They can come from a variety of land- and ocean-based sources, enter the water in many ways, and impact the ocean and Great Lakes. Once in the water, plastic debris never fully biodegrades.    Infographic text:  Commonly found Plastics include cigarette butts, food wrappers, beverage bottles, straws, cups & plates, bottle caps, and single-use bags.    How to help? Reduce, reuse, recycle. Dispose of waste properly no matter where you are. Get involved and participate in local cleanups in your area. Remember that our land and sea are connected.    Impacts include:  Entanglement: Marine life can get caught and killed in derelict fishing nets and other plastic debris.  Ingestion: Animals can easily mistake plastic debris for food.  Sources include:  Boats/nets: Fishing gear can become marine debris when it is lost or abandoned.  Littering: Intentional littering or improper disposal of trash can cause marine debris.  Debris can enter the water via:  Rain & winds: Rain and wind can sweep debris into nearby waterbodies.  Streams & storm drains: Streams and storm drains can carry debris directly into the ocean or Great Lakes.  Microplastics are small plastics less that 5mm. They can come from large plastics breaking down, or can be produced as small plastics such as microbeads, which can be found in products such as toothpaste and face wash.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “Missing the Dark.”    None of this is to say that electric lights are inherently bad. Artificial light has benefited society by, for instance, extending the length of the productive day, offering more time not just for working but also for recreational activities that require light. But when artificial outdoor lighting becomes inefficient, annoying, and unnecessary, it is known as light pollution. Many environmentalists, naturalists, and medical researchers consider light pollution to be one of the fastest growing and most pervasive forms of environmental pollution. And a growing body of scientific research suggests that light pollution can have lasting adverse effects on both human and wildlife health.    Which sentences in the excerpt demonstrate an appeal to the audience’s sense of logos?    Select all that apply.    Missing the Dark

Question Number = 6 of 10

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “Missing the Dark.”    The ecologic effects of artificial light have been well documented. Light pollution has been shown to affect both flora and fauna. For instance, prolonged exposure to artificial light prevents many trees from adjusting to seasonal variations, according to Winslow Briggs’s chapter on plant responses in the 2006 book Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting. This, in turn, has implications for the wildlife that depend on trees for their natural habitat. Research on insects, turtles, birds, fish, reptiles, and other wildlife species shows that light pollution can alter behaviors, foraging areas, and breeding cycles, and not just in urban centers but in rural areas as well.    How does the author appeal to the audience’s sense of logos in this passage?    Missing the Dark
---
---
Responses = ['by making the audience feel empathy for the animals that are affected by changes in the growth of vegetation due to light pollution', 'by convincing the audience of his credibility in explaining how light pollution is equally detrimental to vegetation and the habitat of animals', 'by highlighting that light pollution affects vegetation, which subsequently impacts animals because plants and trees are part of their habitat', 'by establishing a clear message about light pollution to encourage future generations to take a stand against the damaging effects of artificial light']

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “Missing the Dark.”    Travis Longcore, co-editor of Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting and a research associate professor at the University of Southern California Center for Sustainable Cities, suggests two ways outdoor light pollution may contribute to artificial light-associated health effects in humans. “From a human health perspective, it seems that we are concerned with whatever increases artificial light exposure indoors at night,” he says. “The effect of outdoor lighting on indoor exposure could be either direct or indirect. In the direct impact scenario, the artificial light from outside reaches people inside at night at levels that affect production of hormones. In an indirect impact it would disturb people inside, who then turn on lights and expose themselves to more light.”    What is the author’s purpose for appealing to the reader’s sense of ethos in the excerpt?

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “Missing the Dark.”    Each year in New York City alone, about 10,000 migratory birds are injured or killed crashing into skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, says Glenn Phillips, executive director of the New York City Audubon Society.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from the Declaration of Independence.    In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.    Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

Question = Question:  Read the passage from “What Does the ‘Pursuit of Happiness’ Mean in the Declaration of Independence?”    Because happiness was widely considered a natural state for humans in the Jeffersonian era, it was believed to be what God intended and therefore deserved protection. The word’s proximity to two other natural rights—liberty and life—demonstrates that Jefferson found happiness just as important. The legal and social frameworks provided by the Declaration and the Constitution are meant to create that protection. If a large house makes you happy, for example, then another person shouldn’t be able to set it on fire; there are laws against that. What’s more, an individual shouldn’t legally be kept from pursuing that large house.    Which response most accurately explains how the author helps the reader understand the full meaning of the phrase “pursuit of happiness” in the passage?    What Does the ‘Pursuit of Happiness’ Mean?

Yours be the glory to discover by personal experience how long the knee pan can resist the terrible strapping down which you impose—in how short time the well developed muscles of the throat can be reduced to mere threads by the constant pressure of the stock, how high the heel of the boot must be to make a short man tall and how tight the Russian belt may be drawn and yet have wind enough to sustain life. Our ambition leads us neither to discovery or martyrdom of this sort.    The author makes references to stocks, knee pants, and Russian belts to show that men are suffering for their fashion.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address.”    Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from the article “Bias in the Media.”    Consider the ideas of Walter Lippman, one of the most influential journalists of the 20th century. Beginning his career as a reporter, Lippman later became a speechwriter, a magazine and newspaper editor, an author, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and one of the most widely respected political journalists in the world. Lippman was born in 1889 and so came of age as a journalist as World War I unfolded. He became disillusioned with what he saw as the “error, illusion, and misinterpretation” of news reporting during war time. He critiqued the tendency of the press to present propaganda as truth and referred to this practice as the “manufacture of consent.”    Which option most accurately explains how inductive reasoning is used to convey the argument that journalists were engaging in the “manufacture of consent”?    Bias in the Media/Participatory Journalism in the 21st Century

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from the article “Bias in the Media.”    On the contrary, it is wrong to believe that mainstream media has ever achieved true objectivity. Throughout American history, the press has been used as a political tool and as a way to promote particular points of view. For instance, prior to the American Revolution, revolutionary leaders such as Benjamin Franklin used emerging colonial newspapers to rally citizens to the cause of independence. Newspapers, including Franklin’s Pennsylvania Gazette, published political cartoons, news stories hostile to the British, and editorials clearly promoting revolution. In fact, newspapers were one of the primary tools in garnering support for independence from Britain. While the cause may have been noble, the newspapers were clearly a tool of persuasion rather than an objective chronicle of the day’s events.    This theme continues throughout American history. When John Adams was president, he signed the Sedition Act, a law that made it illegal to publish information that was overly critical of the president or Congress. When Thomas Jefferson was running for president he gave money to newspapers that would support him. Even during Abraham Lincoln’s presidency, the government effectively shut down anti-Union newspapers by banning them from mail distribution.    A warrant implied by the author is that media should be impartial, purely reporting facts with no personal perspectives or opinions.    Based on Toulmin’s Model, which option best evaluates how this warrant supports the author’s argument?    Bias in the Media/Participatory Journalism in the 21st Century
---
---
Responses = ['The warrant is mostly effective; some Americans will have trouble identifying bias, so the warrant persuades only the part of the audience that understands bias, leading some to disagree with the argument that the media is biased only in politics and war.', 'The warrant is highly effective; all Americans believe in a free press, so the warrant helps persuade the audience to accept the argument that bias in the media is widespread and a danger to accurate reporting of news.', 'The warrant is completely ineffective; since it is unlikely that the audience will accept the warrant due to its ambiguity, the audience will not be persuaded to believe the argument that the media is biased only in politics and war.', 'The warrant is only somewhat effective; if the audience does not accept or understand the warrant that is implied, then the audience will not accept the argument that bias in the media is widespread and a danger to accurate reporting of news.']

Indeed, my experiments have proven to me that he is the Unreasoning Animal. Note his history, as sketched above. It seems plain to me that whatever he is, he is not a reasoning animal.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “Bias in the Media.”    It is impossible to consider today’s press as truly objective in the face of so much evidence to the contrary, despite the profession’s claims that objectivity is its highest goal. It is the failure to own up to this inherent bias that is most concerning. As always, most news sources subtly, or not so subtly, influence the news that the public is given. The question is, do people realize it?    Lippman believed that the role of journalists was to interpret the news for the public so that individuals could make real choices and judgments based on the information that they were given. The public, consumed by daily life, might simply assume that information is neutral and unbiased. However, American journalism remains plagued by the same array of hidden and not so hidden agendas evident since revolutionary times. The fact that ordinary people may not notice—or, more specifically, care—is the truer threat to democracy.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “The Damned Human Race” by Mark Twain.    Some of my experiments were quite curious. In the course of my reading I had come across a case where, many years ago, some hunters on our Great Plains organized a buffalo hunt for the entertainment of an English earl. They had charming sport. They killed seventy-two of those great animals; and ate part of one of them and left the seventy-one to rot. In order to determine the difference between an anaconda and an earl (if any) I caused seven young calves to be turned into the anaconda’s cage. The grateful reptile immediately crushed one of them and swallowed it, then lay back satisfied. It showed no further interest in the calves, and no disposition to harm them. I tried this experiment with other anacondas; always with the same result. The fact stood proven that the difference between an earl and an anaconda is that the earl is cruel and the anaconda isn’t; and that the earl wantonly destroys what he has no use for, but the anaconda doesn’t.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from Betty Friedan’s essay “The National Organization for Women’s 1966 Statement of Purpose.”    Enormous changes taking place in our society make it both possible and urgently necessary to advance the unfinished revolution of women toward true equality, now. With a life span lengthened to nearly 75 years it is no longer either necessary or possible for women to devote the greater part of their lives to child-rearing; yet childbearing and rearing—which continues to be a most important part of most women’s lives—still is used to justify barring women from equal professional and economic participation and advance.

Responses = ['Childbearing is still the most important part of women’s lives, so women use their longer lives to continue to support their adult children.', 'The bulk of women’s lives is no longer spent having and raising children, so there is no excuse to keep them from developing careers.', 'Longer lives are allowing women more time to advocate for women’s equality, so their position in society is improving.', 'Increased women’s equality in society has improved women’s mental and physical health, extending their lives by decades.']

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from Betty Friedan’s essay “The National Organization for Women’s 1966 Statement of Purpose.”    Today’s technology has reduced most of the productive chores which women once performed in the home and in mass-production industries based upon routine unskilled labor. This same technology has virtually eliminated the quality of muscular strength as a criterion for filling most jobs, while intensifying American industry’s need for creative intelligence. In view of this new industrial revolution created by automation in the mid-twentieth century, women can and must participate in old and new fields of society in full equality—or become permanent outsiders.    Which response most clearly evaluates Friedan’s purpose for mentioning “muscular strength as a criterion for filling most jobs”?    The National Organization for Women’s 1966 Statement of Purpose

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from President Thomas Jefferson’s “Letter to John C. Breckinridge.”    This treaty must of course be laid before both Houses, because both have important functions to exercise respecting it. They, I presume, will see their duty to their country in ratifying & paying for it, so as to secure a good which would otherwise probably be never again in their power. But I suppose they must then appeal to the nation for an additional article to the Constitution, approving & confirming an act which the nation had not previously authorized. The constitution has made no provision for our holding foreign territory, still less for incorporating foreign nations into our Union. The Executive in seizing the fugitive occurrence which so much advances the good of their country, have done an act beyond the Constitution. The Legislature in casting behind them metaphysical subtleties, and risking themselves like faithful servants, must ratify & pay for it, and throw themselves on their country for doing for them unauthorized what we know they would have done for themselves had they been in a situation to do it. It is the case of a guardian, investing the money of his ward in purchasing an important adjacent territory; & saying to him when of age, I did this for your good; I pretend to no right to bind you: you may disavow me, and I must get out of the scrape as I can: I thought it my duty to risk myself for you. But we shall not be disavowed by the nation, and their act of indemnity will confirm & not weaken the Constitution, by more strongly marking out its lines.    In the excerpt, President Jefferson is telling Attorney General Breckinridge that the legislative branch of the government should look over the treaty of the Louisiana Purchase.    How effectively does Jefferson apply the constitutional principle of checks and balances to help convey his perspective?    The Louisiana Purchase/Letter to John C. Breckinridge

Admitting that they understood the people, could they remove that mountain of prejudice that has ever obstructed the streams of justice, and prevent their salutary influence from reaching my devoted countrymen.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from “George W. Harkins to the American People.”    We were hedged in by two evils, and we chose that which we thought the least. Yet we could not recognize the right that the state of Mississippi had assumed, to legislate for us.—Although the legislature of the state were qualified to make laws for their own citizens, that did not qualify them to become law makers to a people that were so dissimilar in manners and customs as the Choctaws are to the Mississippians. Admitting that they understood the people, could they remove that mountain of prejudice that has ever obstructed the streams of justice, and prevent their salutary influence from reaching my devoted countrymen. We as Choctaws rather chose to suffer and be free, than live under the degrading influence of laws, which our voice could not be heard in their formation.

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from Shirley Chisholm’s speech “Equal Rights for Women.”    Let me note and try to refute two of the commonest arguments that are offered against this amendment. One is that women are already protected under the law and do not need legislation. Existing laws are not adequate to secure equal rights for women. Sufficient proof of this is the concentration of women in lower paying, menial, unrewarding jobs and their incredible scarcity in the upper level jobs. If women are already equal, why is it such an event whenever one happens to be elected to Congress?    An argument that Chisholm establishes is that legal workplace protections for women have not created substantial change in women’s daily realities.    Which option best evaluates how effectively Chisholm uses an anticipated counterclaim to support her argument?    Equal Rights for Women

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from Shirley Chisholm’s speech “Equal Rights for Women.”    As a black person, I am no stranger to race prejudice. But the truth is that in the political world I have been far oftener discriminated against because I am a woman than because I am black.    Prejudice against blacks is becoming unacceptable although it will take years to eliminate it. But it is doomed because, slowly, white America is beginning to admit that it exists. Prejudice against women is still acceptable. There is very little understanding yet of the immorality involved in double pay scales and the classification of most of the better jobs as “for men only.”    The Fourteenth Amendment states    All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.    How does Chisholm incorporate the constitutional principle based on the Fourteenth Amendment in the excerpt?    Equal Rights for Women
---
---
Responses = ['by showing that the government has made no effort to enforce the rights of all people', 'by conveying the idea that everyone must live by the words stated in the Constitution', 'by comparing the unequal treatment shared by African Americans and women', 'by explaining how life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are not shared by all citizens']
---
---
Correct Answer = ['by comparing the unequal treatment shared by African Americans and women']

Question = Question:  Read the excerpt from Shirley Chisholm’s speech “Equal Rights for Women.”    More than half of the population of the United States is female. But women occupy only 2 percent of the managerial positions. They have not even reached the level of tokenism yet. No women sit on the AFL-CIO council or Supreme Court. There have been only two women who have held Cabinet rank, and at present there are none. Only two women now hold ambassadorial rank in the diplomatic corps. In Congress, we are down to one Senator and 10 Representatives.    The Ninth Amendment states    The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.    How effectively do the principles of the Ninth Amendment apply to Chisholm’s perspective that women are not treated the same as men?    Equal Rights for Women
---
---
Responses = ['Chisholm ineffectively applies the Ninth Amendment because she fails to specify how women are not being treated equally in society, in business, and by the government.', 'Chisholm effectively applies the Ninth Amendment because she provides evidence that women are not equal in the workplace or in government, illustrating a denial of the rights guaranteed in the amendment.', 'Chisholm ineffectively applies the Ninth Amendment because she fails to establish any proof that women are not given the same rights as men under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.', 'Chisholm effectively applies the Ninth Amendment because she uses the wording of the amendment to show that the Constitution explicitly states men and women are equal, showing that no one should be denied any rights guaranteed in the amendment.']

Correct Answer = ['Chisholm effectively applies the Ninth Amendment because she provides evidence that women are not equal in the workplace or in government, illustrating a denial of the rights guaranteed in the amendment.']

Responses = ['Women need no protection that men do not need. What we need are laws to protect working people, to guarantee them fair pay, safe working conditions, protection against sickness and layoffs, and provision for dignified, comfortable retirement. Men and women need these things equally. That one sex needs protection more than the other is a male supremacist myth.', 'It is obvious that discrimination exists. Women do not have the opportunities that men do. And women that do not conform to the system, who try to break with the accepted patterns, are stigmatized as ‘‘odd’’ and “unfeminine.” The fact is that a woman who aspires to be chairman of the board, or a Member of the House, does so for exactly the same reasons as any man.', 'It is true that part of the problem has been that women have not been aggressive in demanding their rights. This was also true of the black population for many years. They submitted to oppression and even cooperated with it. Women have done the same thing.', 'As in the field of equal rights for blacks, Spanish-Americans, the Indians, and other groups, laws will not change such deep-seated problems overnight. But they can be used to provide protection for those who are most abused, and to begin the process of evolutionary change by compelling the insensitive majority to reexamine its unconscious attitudes.']
