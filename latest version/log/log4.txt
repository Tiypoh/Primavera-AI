Now take the Checkpoint and show what you’ve learned thus far. It will check your understanding of the concepts you've been working on in this lesson. Are you ready?



If you have prepared thoroughly, you should do well. If you have not, now is a good time to go back and review. Take another look at the Key Terms, scan the readings, review the videos, and read over your notes. If you are unsure about anything, ask for help now.



When you are ready, relax, take a deep breath, and get comfortable. If you have difficulty with any of the questions, review the material again and, after reviewing, take the Checkpoint again. Remember, you may take the Checkpoint up to three times. Only your highest score will be recorded in the Gradebook.



Good luck!
