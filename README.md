- Goes back when pages are locked
- Waits for input on:
	- Discussion
	- Project
	- Quiz
	- Match Question
- Checks for assignment
	- Goes to end of page then solves
		- Checks if anything is already selected
		- Grabs box positions
			- Checks type of box to discern single vs multiple choice questions
			- Uses OCR to check for duplicate scanned boxes by reading text next to box
		- Copies question using select all, copy, and pyperclip paste
			- Unselects selection when done
			- Sorts out and filters duplicate text in responses
			- Inserts long description for image into question if available
			- Checks for image copywright 
				- Selects a position above copywright and sees if it can copy image and append
		- Sends question and respones to AI
		- Selects correct boxes
			- Creates lists of correct answers and boxes
				- Checks how many words from each response are in the correct answer
			- For each correct answer number it selects the box of the same number
